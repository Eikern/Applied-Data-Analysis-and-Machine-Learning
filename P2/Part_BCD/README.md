Our Neural network code is inspired by Morten Hjorth-Jensen's code at https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/pub/week41/html/week41.html.

The code is altered to allow for different activation functions and weight initialization method (Xavier) as well as a flexible number of hidden layers.
It also works on both regression and classification problems.
The number of nodes for each hidden layer is the same.
