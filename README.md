# Applied-Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning
Linear regression is a fundamental technique in machine learning and statistical modeling. 
Due to its simplicity and intuitive nature, it can be a good starting point for getting into the world of machine learning. 
In fact, many of the newer, sophisticated algorithms have their roots in linear regression

 In this project  Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge Regression, and LASSO Regression are introduced. 
 To evaluate the model's accuracy and understand the errors, the metrics Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2-Score are calculated. 
 Furthermore, the MSE decomposition into bias and variance gives rise to the Bias-Variance trade-off discussion, and resampling methods like Bootstrap and K-fold Cross-Validation (CV) are implemented to help find the best model.
 The analysis is first conducted on synthetic data using Franke's function, where methods and metrics are optimized. 
 Finally, the methods are applied to real digital terrain data from the area around Mount Fuji, Japan.

 the Code is based on the code from Erikasan https://github.com/erikasan/fys-stk-project1/tree/master/project1, The code has been edited and revised to this prject's objectives.
